    <p>I have a mechanical engineering degree. However, my true passion always has been 
        software development. During my career, I have written code to accelerate the 
        completion of several engineering projects. Software development has never been a 
        chore for me. I have always dreamed in becoming a full-time developer.</p>

    <p>The City Hall of Celaya, Gto. opened an initiative named as "Civil Career 
        Service". The aim was to detect and retain talented individuals already working 
        for the City Hall. As part of the initiative, employees are required to take 
        performance assessments twice a year. The City Hall of Celaya hired a software 
        development company to implement and app for computing the results of work 
        performance evaluation. I was hired as part of a software development team to 
        write the app. </p>

    <h2>Research and Development Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila Campus Torreón, México 2016 – 2018</h2>
    <p>I secured funding for MNX$500,000.00 to set up a composite manufacturing and research lab. 
        As part of the research, I recruited two undergrad students to program an industrial robot. 
        I wrote a software in Java to teach the robot the points required to traverse a path full of 
        obstacles. </p>
    
    <ul>

    <h2>Research and development engineer Formax Multiaxial Reinforcements - United Kingdom 2015 – 2016</h2>
    <p>I worked in a project to develop novel technology for manufacturing carbon fibre reinforced 
        composites. I developed several automation projects which involved the design of ground-breaking 
        machinery to produce the next generation of carbon reinforced composites and I wrote PLC software to 
        make them work. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>C/C++ to develop PLC software.</li>
        <li>Linux command line as development platform.</li>
